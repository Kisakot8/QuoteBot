# QuoteBot
A bot used to save quotes to a Quote Book, from which they can later be recalled.

## Features
# User Commands
**/save group**
Saves quotes to the Quote Book in one of 3 ways:
- **`/save text <text>`** - saves specified text to the Quote Book. Due to Discord's slash commands format, this is a single-line text only.
- **`/save image <image> [text]`** - saves an image (such as a screenshot of a message) with optional text to the Quote Book.
- **`/save long [image]`** - saves longer, multi-line text with an optional image to the Quote Book. After executing the command, a Modal (text box) will pop up where the text can be entered.
In addition, all of these save the following:
- The quote's author (user who saved the quote)
- The date the quote was saved
- The quote's ID

**`/list [page]`**
Lists quotes saved in the Quote Book, 10 per page. Only the first line of text is displayed, meaning images and multiple lines cannot be seen (to see these, see /quote). Other data displayed includes:
- The quote ID
- The quote's author
- The date the quote was saved
- If the quote has an image or multiple lines
Page number can be specified (defaults to 1), but once the command is run, pages can be scrolled through using the buttons (First, Previous, Next, Last).
  
**`/quote <id>`**
Shows a quote using its ID. The ID of a quote is shown when it is saved, when it is seen in the list or when it is randomly generated by /random. The displayed quuote will show all quote information:
- The full quote's text (showing multiple lines)
- Any image attachments
- The quote's author
- The date the quote was saved

**`/random`**
Shows a random quote from the Quote Book. A new one can be generated by pressing a button.
Functions the same way as /quote, but with a random ID number.

**`/search [contains] [has_image] [author] [page]`**
Displays quotes matching specified parameters:
- **contains** - whether the quote contains certain text
- **has_image** - whether the quote has an image (bool)
- **author** - the quote's author (Discord user)
Page number can be specified; works same as /list

**`/delete <id>`**
Deletes a quote by its ID. A quote can only be deleted if the user executing the command is:
- The quote's author
- A moderator (see below)
- An administrator (see below)
This action cannot be undone.

**`/ping`**
Returns the bot's ping.

# Moderation Commands
**Administrator** - a user with at least one of the following permissions:
- Administrator
- Manage Server
- Manage Roles
- Manage Channels
- Manage Messages

**Moderator** - a user with at least one of the following permissions:
- Time out members
- Ban Members
- Kick Members
- Any of the ones listed in Administrator

**`/massdelete [contains] [has_image] [author]`**: **Admin-only**
Deletes quotes matching parameters en-masse:
- **contains** - whether the quote contains certain text
- **has_image** - whether the quote has an image (bool)
- **author** - the quote's author (Discord user)
The command will send a confirmation message, stating the number of quotes about to be deleted. If the user changed their mind, they can cancel the command. Otherwise, after confirming, the quotes specified will be deleted. Just like /delete, this cannot be undone.
